## Description of the Project

This capstone is an e-commerce application, or an online store that customers will be able to add products to cart, see a range of price-budget-friendly items of thier selection, and purchase items. 
The API front end will be able to be edited with minor changes and the project will need to be debugged in insomnia. As a developer, I was able to change the Front End online store application from light to dark mode background by adding the code to the html line of code. 

## User Stories


- As a  user, I want to add products to my shopping cart from the product list, So that I can save them for later and purchase them in a single transaction.
  
- As a user, I want to filter the product list by specific categories (such as "Electronics" so that I can quickly find the specific types of items I am interested in without scrolling through the entire inventory.
  
- As a user, I want to click on a category and see only the products belonging to that group, so that I can browse a curated list of related items without seeing irrelevant products.
  
- As a user with administrative privileges, I want to add completely new categories to the store's catalog, so that I can expand the business into new product lines and keep different types of items logically separated.
